This repository is a  compilation of code and data I used from freely available materials to brush up my genomics/transcriptomics analysis skills.
## Three key resources used so far for learning:
1) Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop : https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/
2) EMBL-EBI training materials from old genomics workshop: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/materials/genome-bioinformatics-materials/unix-and-bash/
3) CRUK course on Introduction to NGS: https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/ngs-in-bioc
